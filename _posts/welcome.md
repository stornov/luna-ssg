# Hello! You're all set.

You have successfully set up a new static site generated by **Luna SSG**, a lightweight and powerful engine written in Python.

This page is a basic example of a blog post. It supports standard Markdown and has a clean, minimal design out of the box.

For a full demonstration of all supported elements (including tables, quotes, and terminal-style code blocks), check out our **[Markdown Features Demo](/luna-ssg/markdown-demo)** post.

## Quick Start

1. Edit the `_config.yml` file to personalize your site.
2. Delete this file and the examples file in the `_posts/` directory.
3. Start writing your own content!

Happy blogging!
